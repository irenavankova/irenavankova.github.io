<p>I study physical processes in polar regions. I use modeling, observational, and data-analysis approaches to understand interactions between ice-sheets and the ocean.</p>

<p>At the Los Alamos National Laboratory I develop the <a href="https://e3sm.org/" rel="nofollow">Energy Exascale Earth System Model</a> and use it to study the role of freshwater fluxes from Antarctica on the Southern Ocean.</p>

<p>While at the British Antarctic Survey, I worked primarily with <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/groundbased-radar-for-measuring-vertical-strain-rates-and-timevarying-basal-melt-rates-in-ice-sheets-and-shelves/B952737EB6DDB3D129DF12FC206DC3EB" rel="nofollow">ApRES</a> (phase-sensitive radar) measurements from Antarctic ice shelves. ApRES is deployed at the ice shelf surface and operates autonomously year-round. It monitors displacement of internal ice reflectors as well as changes in position of the ice shelf base which is in contact with the ocean. These data contain information about physical processes at the ice shelf base, such as melting, and about the ice dynamics. A unique feature of this technique is that it allows the detection and study of temporal variability of these processes. Apart from detecting basal melt rate, which ApRES was originally designed for, this project has lead me towards new interests, such as mesoscale dynamics, ice shelf tidal dynamics, basal melting and freezing processes, and frazil ice dynamics.</p>

<p>ApRES-derived basal melt observations are essential for model validation and I am participating in a working group that coordinates <a href="http://soos.aq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=113" rel="nofollow">NECKLACE</a>, an international effort to monitor basal melting beneath Antarctic ice shelves. </p>

<p>During my PhD I studied Greenland's glacier fjords. The inspiration for the projects I have researched came from annual field campaigns, and mostly combined observations with models. However, one of my favorite projects was purely modeling and it was concerned with developing an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JC013012" rel="nofollow">ice mélange model</a>.</p>

<p>In the austral summer of 2021/2022 I undertook field work at the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. I led a field experiment aimed at inferring ice crystal orientation from phase-sensitive radar measurements. I also serviced and redeployed multiple ApRES which form part of a long term monitoring project aimed at understanding the evolution and variability of the rate of ocean melting at the ice-shelf base.</p>
				<p>
During summers 2014-2018 I took part in annual field campaigns to two Greenland glacier fjord systems; Sermilik Fjord and Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland, and Ilulissat Fjord and Jakobshavn Isbræ in west Greenland.
I conducted oceanographic surveys in the fjords with the goal of understanding their hydrographic variability and its impacts on the nearby glaciers.
I also took part in monitoring the dynamics of Helheim Glacier using combination of instruments including ground based radars, GPS, and seismometers.</p>
